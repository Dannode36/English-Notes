# Effect List

- - -

  

Effects are the fourth column of each channel, used to modify notes currently played.

Each effect is followed by a parameter, "xx", from 00-99, which controls the intensity of the effect.  
Some effects have 2 parameters, written as "xy", these are instead in hexadecimal, from 00-FF to offer greater range for a single digit.

Below is a list of all the effects in WaveTracker
