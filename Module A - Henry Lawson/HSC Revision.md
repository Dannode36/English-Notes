## How have the texts you have studies explored how groups have adapted to change?
### Plan
Groups -> Bushmen, Australian Women, Union Members
Adaption to change -> Resilience, Masculine, Harsh Conditions

Adaption to change is an important theme addressed by many of Henry Lawsons texts. The Drovers Wife, The Loaded Dog, and The Union Buries Its Dead all express the resilience and masculinity characters form through their emotionally shaping adaptations to harsh environments.
## Has your study of texts focusing on cultural voice affirmed or refuted common stereotypes? How is this idea explored in your prescribed text and ONE related text.

Affirmed Stereotypes -> Larrikin-like and humorous nature of Australian Bushmen
