### Introduction
Many individuals in relationships experience abuse of power and extortion. Many texts explore this theme of abuse of power in relationships as a central and pivotal theme. In Peter Weirs' film, The Truman Show, abuse of power in relationships and related ideas are explored through Christof's extortion and control of Truman's everyday life. Truman's environment and hometown, Seahaven, is artificially constructed, manipulated, and broadcast to the world, 24/7 as part of a voyeuristic reality TV production aptly named, The Truman Show.

### Body Paragraph
Reality is a naturally complex system and difficult subject to replicate. The Truman Show makes an attempt at simulating an entire town centred around the protagonist, Truman Burbank, in order to control his environment. Christof fabricates an enormous film set called Seahaven, where Truman is manipulated into staying. Although the set is a technical marvel, it introduces the limits of simulated reality. 
In the very first scene of the film, the audience is oriented into Trumans life, the town of Seahaven, and his neighbours via a range of camera angles, dialogue choices and costume design. As he gets to his car, a stage light falls from the sky and crashes on the road. The light is also labelled "Sirius", which is a constellation and considered the brightest star in the sky, alluding to Truman, that his reality is secretly controlled. This outlines the limits of his reality, and it's fragility.
