### Essay
Many composers explore the concerns of manipulation and consumerism as a way to draw readers into alternate worlds and develop a deeper comprehension of the human experience. Peter Weirs, "The Truman Show", is a prime example of this journey into the way humans experience reality. In The Truman Show, manipulation and commercialism are explored through Christof's extortion and control of Truman's everyday life. Truman's environment and hometown, Seahaven, is artificially constructed, manipulated, and broadcast to the world, 24/7 as part of a commercialised and voyeuristic reality TV production aptly named, The Truman Show.

Manipulation is inherently the most prominent idea traversed in The Truman Show. Christof, the director of the fictional show, created what is considered the world's greatest TV show based on a 24/7 live broadcast of Truman Burbank's everyday life. Truman's entire environment is constructed and controlled by Christof, inviting ideas of a god-like complex and manipulation into the protagonist's life. A prime example of the depth of manipulation Christof possesses in Seahaven is during Truman's father's death. Christof purposely fakes the drowning of the main character's father while they are on a sailing trip together, with the intention of scaring him to remain on the island of Seahaven. The effects of this manipulation are present throughout the film, including when Truman tries to catch a ferry to a neighbouring island but ultimately hurries away in fear after being provoked by the sight of a sunken dingy next to the pier. The use of "mise-en-scene" in placement of the dingy by Christof and Peter Weir's use of camera angles and shots showing Truman's gaze, visually demonstrates to the audience the extent of manipulation Christof has in Truman’s life.

Manipulation of Truman through the full extent of his environment, addresses the thematic interests of how manipulation affects how a human experiences life, making The Truman Show a real and relevant composition that viewers are drawn into.

In a world run by capitalist ideologies, The Truman show is no exception when it comes to advertisements and product placement in its 24/7 agenda. As Truman navigates his everyday life, the people around him whom he considers his closest, actively seek to display and promote new products to the audience watching, while masking it as a suggestion to Truman. This often reflects the real world where TV is fueled by rampant consumerism and the fear of missing out on the “new best thing”, closely relating this text to a viewer's reality. This only layers onto the mental manipulation Truman experiences everyday of his life. A perfect example of product placement comes from Truman’s wife, Meryl, when she returns from the supermarket to find him gardening. She turns to Truman with a “Chef’s Pal” in her hands and states “It's a dicer, grater, peeler, all in one. Never needs sharpening, dishwasher safe!”. Meryl’s choice of words provide the snappy and catchy language successful advertisements utilise, clearly bringing to light her commercial interest and the manipulation the fictional viewers of The Truman Show suffer. Near the end of the film Meryl makes another attempt at recommending a product to Truman in an attempt to change the conversation as Truman begins to realise his surroundings are all a facade for something bigger. Meryl tries to sell Truman some Mococoa chocolate drink powder saying , “Why don't you let me fix you some of this Mococoa drink? All natural cocoa beans from the upper slopes of Mount Nicaragua. No artificial sweeteners.“. This prompts Truman to look around and respond with “What the hell are you talking about?”. Truman understands that her choice of language is not usual or normal to any conversation between them and further pushes his idea that the world around him is not as he initially thought. Throughout all of Meryl’s product placement scenes, a zooming close up shot is formed onto her face and the product as she switches into advertisement mode, creating a sense of importance in the product being displayed.  This commercialistic venture propels viewers to become aware of Truman’s manipulative and simulated reality and begs them to reflect on their own situations, generating a relationship of similarity between their own and the protagonist's world, drawing them into the narrative.

Peter Weir’s The Truman Show meaningfully explores ideas of manipulation and consumerism in order to grab the attention of viewers and bring them into alternate worlds. These ideas are investigated through Christof's godlike extortion and control of Truman's everyday life in the town of Seahaven. Peter Weir, and consequently Christof, offer a wide range of cinematic and textual techniques including; word choice, camera shots and angles, and mise-en-scene, to construct a solid foundation for understanding how humans perceive and understand reality.
