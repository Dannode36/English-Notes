# How does Peter Weir use characterisation to evoke significant ideas about the film "The Truman Show"
### Thesis
Many composers explore the thematic ideas surrounding characterisation through manipulation, consumerism and voyeurism as a way to present thoughts and considerations about texts.
### Examples
- Manipulation
    - Truman's fathers death manipulates Truman into staying on the island by manifesting a fear of water
    - Truman's love life is controlled and he is manipulated into marrying Meryl. His true love is Sylvia
    - Travel agent tries to discourage Truman from going to Fiji. "I'm sorry, I don't have anything for at least a month"
- Commercialism
    - Truman and Marlon play golf off a bridge
    - Meryl promotes the Chef's Pal
