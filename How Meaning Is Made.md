    1. What the text means
    2. How meaning is made
- It is a good idea to think of a "how meaning is made" question as having 3 parts
    1. What is happening
    2. What techniques are used by the author to influence the reader's thinking/understanding/response
    3. What do the first two questions do to my understanding of human experience
- Prose: paragraph structure, sentence construction, punctuation, language level, imagery, word choice, etc.
- Poetry: stanza construction and length, imagery, sound techniques, etc.
- Visual: framing, use of colour, positioning of people and objects, figurative language, etc.
- Lyrics: textual and musical features
