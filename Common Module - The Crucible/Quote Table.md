## Reputation
Reputation: The beliefs or opinions that are generally held about someone or something

In Salem, reputation held no bargaining value once a person was placed on trial. Yet still, we see characters fight to save their reputation with their life AND integrity on the line. It can be said that characters "think through reputation".

| “But if you trafficked with spirits in the forest I must know it now, for surely my enemies will, and they will ruin me with it” (Parris) | Words like "trafficked" and "spirits" feature connotations of witchcraft and danger, creating a sense of fear and urgency especially when considering the historical context. (What is the context?) <br>"Trafficked" especially implies illicit or forbidden dealings, which heightens the gravity of the situation.<br><br>Parris mentions his enemies "will ruin me", foreshadowing the eventual downfall of his reputation after the trials begin.<br><br>Parris's tone is accusatory and anxious, realising to the reader that he fears tainting his reputation either through his own doing or having it destroyed by enemies                                                 |
| "You will confess yourself or you will hang! (He turns her roughly to face him). Do you know who I am?" (Danforth to Mary Warren)         | Danforth's use of strongly assertive language towards those in his court expose his egotistical attitude towards reputation over his own integrity.<br><br>The use of stage direction preceding "Do you know who I am?" further implies that Danforth is a selfish man who pictures himself as a person of higher value, willing to lay his hands on those he deems lesser within his court.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| "How may I live without my name? I have given you my soul; leave me my name!" (John Proctor)                                              | Proctor chooses to value his reputation over his own life after being offered to have his life spared if he publicises his own atrocities. <br><br>"How may I live without my name?" epitomises this theme of reputation within The Crucible, adding to the repeated motif of "name" reinforcing its importance in the Puritan society.<br><br>The rhetorical question in "How may I live without my name?" highlights Proctors desperate struggle to preserve his reputation. Being a question with no answer, Proctor highlights the impossibility of living without personal integrity and further evokes a sense of pity towards his metaphorical meeting at a moral crossroad. |
