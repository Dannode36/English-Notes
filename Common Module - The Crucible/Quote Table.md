## Reputation
Reputation (n.): The beliefs or opinions that are generally held about someone or something

In Salem, reputation held no bargaining value once a person was placed on trial. Yet still, we see characters fight to save their reputation with their life AND integrity on the line. It can be said that characters "think through reputation".

| “But if you trafficked with spirits in the forest I must know it now, for surely my enemies will, and they will ruin me with it” (Parris) | Words like "trafficked" and "spirits" feature connotations of witchcraft and danger, creating a sense of fear and urgency especially when considering the historical context. (What is the context?) <br>"Trafficked" especially implies illicit or forbidden dealings, which heightens the gravity of the situation.<br><br>Parris mentions his enemies "will ruin me", foreshadowing the eventual downfall of his reputation after the trials begin.<br><br>Parris's tone is accusatory and anxious, realising to the reader that he fears tainting his reputation either through his own doing or having it destroyed by enemies                                                 |
| "You will confess yourself or you will hang! (He turns her roughly to face him). Do you know who I am?" (Danforth to Mary Warren)         | Danforth's use of strongly assertive language towards those in his court expose his egotistical attitude towards reputation over his own integrity.<br><br>The use of stage direction preceding "Do you know who I am?" further implies that Danforth is a selfish man who pictures himself as a person of higher value, willing to lay his hands on those he deems lesser within his court.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| "How may I live without my name? I have given you my soul; leave me my name!" (John Proctor)                                              | Proctor chooses to value his reputation over his own life after being offered to have his life spared if he publicises his own atrocities. <br><br>"How may I live without my name?" epitomises this theme of reputation within The Crucible, adding to the repeated motif of "name" reinforcing its importance in the Puritan society.<br><br>The rhetorical question in "How may I live without my name?" highlights Proctors desperate struggle to preserve his reputation. Being a question with no answer, Proctor highlights the impossibility of living without personal integrity and further evokes a sense of pity towards his metaphorical meeting at a moral crossroad. |

| "There are wheels within wheels in this village, and fires within fires!" (Ann Putnam)                              | Mrs Putnam's paranoid tone in the metaphorical phrase "wheels within wheels, and fires within fires" suggests to the audience that Mrs Putnam is foreshadowing of the vicious and impending cycle of hysteria the village will bring upon itself. <br><br>The idea of "fire" is a Puritan allusion to Hell or damnation, reinforcing the fear of evil forces influencing the village, adding a religious dimension to the hysteria. <br>This exposes a key element in the downfall of Salem, realising to the reader that control over the idea of an evil force like the devil, yields control over the entire village and its sanity.<br><br>HISTORICAL CONTEXT:<br>The proposition of an ideology so powerful and strongly believed that entire towns yield to it, is exactly what Arthur Miller set out to explore in The Crucible. <br>The power of religion within the play and the Trials as a whole, pose as an allegory for Millers own dealings with McCarthyism and the Red Scare.  During the reign of Senator McCarthy, many everyday Americans like Miller, were accused of being Communist usually in an abusive attempt to extort them |
| "The Devil is alive in Salem, and we dare not quail to follow wherever the accusing finger points!" (Reverend Hale) | A direct reference to "The Devil" highlights Puritanism's grip on the direction of the trials seen in The Crucible. "We dare not quail to follow.." reveals to the reader the controlling hysteria religion has through the fearful tone Hale speaks.<br><br>"...the accusing finger..." poses as references to the idea that those who are accused should point the finger at another to pass on the accusation. McCarthyism followed a very similar pattern. Whereby those accused would be granted freedom if they expose others for being potential communists, revealing another injection of Millers personal experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| "There are them that will swear to anything before they’ll hang; have you never thought of that?" (John Proctor)    | Proctors aggravated tone and rhetorical question invite the reader to consider the ironic absurdity of the trials, where those who are accused of lying are encouraged to lie to avoid being hanged. This further depicts the chaos and hysteria that is slowly drowning the town.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
