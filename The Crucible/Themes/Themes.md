## Four reasons why themes are important
1. Themes help guide our thinking to what the purpose of the text is. 
	- What is the composer attempting to convey? 
2. Themes provide insight into what cultures value (original and contemporary). 
	- What is being valued in the text, and how does this resonate with an audience
3. Themes are dynamic. They emerge from an intimate relationship between composer and responder and text and culture. 
4. Mastering themes on a deeper, conceptual level will enrich your analysis
	- Basic: Top-level idea, what's in front of you
	- Extended: Significance, implied meaning
		- What is being said about this idea?
