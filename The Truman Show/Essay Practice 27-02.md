### Body Paragraph
Dramatic conflict is a vital component to audience engagement in The Truman Show. Peter Weir conjugates dramatic conflict and power of the media to highlight Christof's manipulative behaviour towards Truman and his simulated reality to the viewer. When Truman makes an attempt to leave Seahaven by ferry, he's caught frozen in fear on the pier after his gaze meets a sunken dingy. Weir's use of camera angles to dictate Truman's gaze, and Christof's use of mis en scene in placement of the sunken boat, clearly indicate to the audience Christof's attempts to manipulate the protagonist to stay on the island.
