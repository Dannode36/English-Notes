### Essay
Many composers explore the concerns of manipulation and consumerism as a way to draw readers into alternate worlds and develop a deeper comprehension of the human experience. Peter Weirs, "The Truman Show", is a prime example of this journey into the way humans experience reality. In The Truman Show, manipulation and commercialism are explored through Christof's extortion and control of Truman's everyday life. Truman's environment and hometown, Seahaven, is artificially constructed, manipulated, and broadcast to the world, 24/7 as part of a commercialised and voyeuristic reality TV production aptly named, The Truman Show.

Manipulation is inherently the most prominent idea traversed in The Truman Show. Christof, the director of the fictional show, created what is considered the world's greatest TV show based on a 24/7 live broadcast of Truman Burbank's everyday life. Truman's entire environment is constructed and controlled by Christof, inviting ideas of a god-like complex and manipulation into the protagonist's life. A prime example of the depth of manipulation Christof possesses in Seahaven is during Truman's father's death. Christof purposely fakes the drowning of the main character's father while they are on a sailing trip together, with the intention of scaring him to remain on the island of Seahaven. 
The effects of this manipulation are present throughout the film, including when Truman tries to catch a ferry to a neighbouring island but ultimately hurries away in fear after being provoked by the sight of a sunken dingy next to the pier. The use of "mise-en-scene" in placement of the dingy by Christof (in reality Peter Weir) and Peter Weir's use of camera angles and shots showing Truman's gaze, visually demonstrates to the audience the extent of manipulation Christof has in his life.
Manipulation of Truman through the full extent of his environment, addresses the thematic interests of how manipulation affects how a human experiences life, making The Truman Show a real and relevant composition that viewers are drawn into.

In a world run by capitalist ideologies, The Truman show is no exception when it comes to advertisements and product placement in its 24/7 agenda.
